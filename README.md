**Brief Discription:**

It is a 2D shooting game (similar to chicken invaders). The main game idea is that there is an enemy (attacker) that moves along the screen and keeps moving left and right. There is a moving background. The main shooter (the player) tries to throw bullets/ weapons/ anything on the enemy; which attacks the player by firing obstacles. If the player is hit by one obstacle, it loses the game. The shooter (player) fires at the target (enemy) till the health of the enemy reaches zero then a new enemy appears with more health (larger value for health).
